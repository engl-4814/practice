# Git Practice & Sectioning Elements

Practice folder for learning about git and sectioning elements.

The MDN reading for today reviewed different "content categories" for HTML elements:

- **Metadata**: Elements typically in the `head`, such as `title`, `meta`, `link`, etc.
- **Flow**: BIG group of elements that typically reside in the `body`, such as commonly used block or inline elements like `p`, `a`, `ul` or `ol`, `li`, `img`, `em`. One element to note is the `main` element, which isn't actually defined as a sectioning element. IMHO, `main` should be! :-)
- **Sectioning**: Subset of flow that create more explicitly semantic scope of heading content, such as `header`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `nav`, `footer`. These create scope for your headings and produce **landmarks** on your page. This helps ARIA technologies, like screen readers, create a more usable experience of the page.
- **Heading**: `h1`-`h6`

In this lesson, you will take an existing page with an implicit heading structure and revise it by incorporating sectioning elements to give it an explicitly semantic structure.

## Assignment Setup

1. Copy the `lindgren.html` file into this folder.
2. Rename the file with your lastname, i.e., replace my lastname with your own.

## What to Do

In groups of 2-3 people, do the following:

1. Take a few moments individually to scan through the HTML and content. As you do so, consider how you could create a more explicitly semantic structure of the content with some of the structuring elements that we learned about for today: `header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`.
2. As a group, discuss your ideas and decide on a structure that you all think may be appropriate given the implicit structuring of the content.
3. Revise the page with this structure, then push your changes to Github with GH Desktop.

You can definitely work together throughout this process.
